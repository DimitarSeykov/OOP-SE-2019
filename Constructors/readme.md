# constructors, arrays of objects, dynamic memory

## Task 1
Implement a class Grade, comprised of a value and a course name. Make sure all the data is valid. Create at least 2 constructors.

## Task 2
Implement a class Student, comprised of the information about a student - name, faculty number and a list of Grades. 
The number of grades is not a constant - let it be given as a parameter in the constructor. 

What possible issues or problems might come up while working with the Grades array?
