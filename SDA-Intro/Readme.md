# Introduction do Data structures and algorithms (for interview preparation purposes)

Topics covered the first week: 
- Basics of algorithms' time complexity. Examples for each of the basic complexities - constant, logaritmic, linear, nlogn, quadratic, cubic, exponential
- Slow sorting algorithms. Selection Sort.
- Fast sorting algorithms. Quicksort and Merge Sort. Note that no comparison-based sorting algorithm can be asimptotically fatser than O(nlogn).
- Sorting algorithms stability. Examples. Explanations of the inner workings of std::sort() (just mentioning heap sort) and std::stable_sort().
- Non conventional sorting algorithms: Counting sort. Application for negative numbers.
- Searching algotihms. Linear and Binary search.
- Binary searching the answer.

Topics left for next week:
- Introduction to data structures.
- Linked List. (Singly/Doubly linked).
- Stack. Queue. Deque.
- Tree-like structures. Binary-Search Tree
- Quick overview of self-balancing trees: ideas behind AVL and RB.
- Quick overview of Heap, Trie and, ideally, Segment(Interval) tree.
- Abstract Data structures. Graphs. Graph representation.
- Graph Traversal algorithms - BFS, DFS. Topological Sorting.
- Hashing.
