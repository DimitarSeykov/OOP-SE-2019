# Inheritance


 Create a class Building, which describes a given building with a height (meters, integer), area (square meters, float) and addres (char*). Define derived class House, which is additionally desribed with umber of floors (int) and home owner (char*). For both classes define:

-  appropriate selectors and mutators;

-  method for input from the keyboard and display on the screen;

- a function to find the most spacious house from a given array of Houses. We define the most spacious as the one with the highest average area per floor.

Be creative. Be curious. Create something more. Maybe create another derived class? What are the connections between the classes?
